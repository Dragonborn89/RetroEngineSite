      <p>
        RetroEngine began as a blank D3D12 window, a personal experiment to see if a CRT could be simulated not as a filter, but as a physical system. Within the first week, that idea evolved into a functioning real-time display model, complete with beam scanning, phosphor decay, and color-accurate light response.
      </p>

      <p>
        The renderer now reproduces real phosphor layouts, beam afterglow, and even a simple 3D scene, all rendered through a fully simulated CRT pipeline. This marks the foundation of RetroEngine’s goal: not imitation, but reconstruction of analog light.
