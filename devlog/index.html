    <p>
      RetroEngine began as a blank D3D12 window, a personal experiment to see if a CRT could be simulated not as a filter, but as a physical system. Within the first week, that idea evolved into a functioning real-time display model, complete with beam scanning, phosphor decay, and color-accurate light response.
    </p>

    <p>
      The renderer now reproduces real phosphor layouts, beam afterglow, and even a simple 3D scene, all rendered through a fully simulated CRT pipeline. This marks the foundation of RetroEngine’s goal: not imitation, but reconstruction of analog light.

  <p>
    With the CRT renderer stable, this phase focused on structure and scalability; defining how RetroEngine organizes and renders its world. The new ECS-style architecture introduces clean separation between data and behavior, with components for scenes, materials, and gpu meshes, driving a modular pipeline.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first 3D scene renderer now runs with verified Blinn–Phong lighting, world-space normals, and HDR output feeding directly into the CRT simulation stage. This milestone proves the engine’s rendering core is stable enough to support both 2D and 3D pipelines under a single system.
